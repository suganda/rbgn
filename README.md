rubygoni, web app generator based on epigoni metadata (with or without ?) rails framework
while attemp practicing ruby since i'm a new comer in this language as well as in web development field.

first of all, i'll try to describe what epigoni is, epigoni is an engine for building (currently desktop) application. And the way this stuff 
work is to define (write) the app definition (menus, form, grid, action etc) in a database (we called metadata) (default is in firerbird, but it can also in other db).
So the epigoni application file (ie EXE files), is all (well may be 99,99%) are the same, it depend to which metadata is used.

Epigoni studio is the tool how the app definition was built.

And now (while improving ruby and then rails) i'll try to access that metadata to generate web app code, of course this is huge work, but 
a thousand miles journey is started by one simple step, right ? :)
